# Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
# Algorithm: 
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate audio content (e.g., music, sound effects, voice narration) using AI model

# Output:
## Methodology (Step-by-Step)
## Step 1 — Define Tasks

Explore three audio domains:

Music (melodies, beats, ambient loops)

Sound Effects (SFX) (environmental, mechanical, natural sounds)

Voice Narration (storytelling, character voices, announcements)

## Step 2 — Identify Prompting Techniques

Zero-shot prompts → Plain descriptive instructions.

Few-shot prompts → Provide examples or style cues in the prompt.

Structured prompts → Use templates like Genre: Mood: Tempo:.

Constraint-based prompts → Explicit exclusions/inclusions (e.g., “no drums”).

Iterative refinement → Generate → feedback prompt → regenerate.

Multi-modal conditioning → Combine text with reference audio/MIDI.

Persona/Style tokens → Narration voices, emotions, accents.

Negative prompting → Instruct the model what not to include.

Parameter prompting → Modify temperature, top-p, or duration.

Editing prompts → Replace/extend sections of audio via instructions.

## Step 3 — Experimentation Plan

For each domain (music, SFX, narration) → test multiple prompting styles.

Vary parameters (temperature, seed, top-p) to see diversity vs. coherence.

Compare iterative refinement vs. single-shot generation.

Log prompt text, model outputs, and metadata for consistency.

## Step 4 — Evaluation Metrics

Objective

Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) — quality vs. real data.

Kernel Audio Distance (KAD) — improved version of FAD.

Signal metrics (SDR, SI-SDR) when comparing edited audio.

Subjective

Mean Opinion Score (MOS) — human naturalness ratings.

Preference tests (A/B) — compare outputs of different prompt styles.

Task-specific perception — e.g., clarity of narration, realism of SFX, musicality.

## Step 5 — Expected Outcomes

Zero-shot → broad but less controlled outputs.

Few-shot/structured → better alignment with user intent.

Constraint/negative prompts → useful but models may sometimes fail.

Iterative refinement → higher quality but slower.

Multi-modal conditioning → best for precise control, but model-dependent.

## Step 6 — Documentation & Insights

Record which prompting styles work best for each audio type.

Summarize failure cases (e.g., ignoring constraints, artifacts).

Provide guidelines for effective prompts in music, SFX, and narration.

✅ With this approach, your project will not only explore multiple prompting strategies but also create a comparative framework for understanding how prompts shape AI-generated audio.
